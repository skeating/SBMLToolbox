function SBMLReaction = Reaction_setReversible(SBMLReaction, reversible)
%
%   Reaction_setReversible 
%             takes  1) an SBMLReaction structure 
%             and    2) an integer representing the reversible to be set
%
%             and returns 
%               the reaction with the reversible set
%
